## Built With
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Running the Project
- `npm run start` — to launch the server.
- `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature.

## Ideas for Further Development
- <b>Optimization:</b> Cache the JSON files when the server is started instead of creating a read stream for every user request.
- <b>Optional:</b> Try to implement the server in another programming language, perhaps C++ or C#.
